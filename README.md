This project explores using the opengl matrix stack to make a 3D object using simple shapes such as spheres, cubes, and cylinders through simple transformations such as scale, rotate, and transform. Using only these tools, I created a Poliwag Pokemon. The next step will be to animate this Poliwag Pokemon.
